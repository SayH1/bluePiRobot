QA Challenge - Robot Framework on To-Do-List website

Note - My Chromedriver is version 101, and I have added it to my PATH so it won't be included in the test code. Don't forget to configure this first before running the tests.

Extra note - I used VS code with Robot Framework extension to write this tests, but it shouldn't cause any issue even if you run it on different IDE.
